## ADR-006: Use Dexie.js and IndexedDB for Client-Side Data Storage

Date: 2025-07-07
Status: Accepted
Deciders: Frontend Team, Backend Team

### Context

Our application needs robust client-side data storage for offline functionality, caching API responses, and storing user preferences. The browser's localStorage has size limitations and lacks advanced querying capabilities, while direct IndexedDB usage is complex and verbose. We need a solution that provides structured data storage with querying capabilities while maintaining simplicity and TypeScript support.

### Decision Drivers

* **Storage Capacity**: Support for large amounts of structured data beyond localStorage limits
* **Offline Capability**: Enable application functionality without network connectivity
* **Query Performance**: Efficient querying and indexing for complex data operations
* **TypeScript Support**: Type-safe database operations and schema definitions
* **Developer Experience**: Simplified API compared to raw IndexedDB
* **Data Relationships**: Support for relational data patterns and foreign keys

### Considered Options

1. **Dexie.js**: Modern IndexedDB wrapper with TypeScript support and advanced querying
2. **LocalForage**: Simple key-value storage with IndexedDB fallback
3. **iDB**: Lightweight IndexedDB wrapper with Promise-based API
4. **Raw IndexedDB**: Direct usage of browser's IndexedDB API
5. **WebSQL**: Deprecated SQL database in browsers (not recommended)
6. **SQLite WASM**: WebAssembly-based SQLite in the browser

### Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** Dexie.js.
We have chosen Dexie.js because it provides a powerful, developer-friendly wrapper around IndexedDB with excellent TypeScript support and advanced querying capabilities. It offers the right balance of simplicity and functionality, allowing us to implement complex offline-first features while maintaining clean, type-safe code.

### Positive Consequences

* **Rich Query API**: SQL-like querying with support for complex filters, sorting, and pagination
* **TypeScript Excellence**: Full type safety with schema definitions and query results
* **Offline-First**: Robust foundation for offline functionality and progressive web app features
* **Performance**: Efficient indexing and querying for large datasets
* **Data Integrity**: Transaction support and data consistency guarantees
* **Reactive Updates**: Built-in observability for real-time UI updates
* **Migration Support**: Schema versioning and migration capabilities

### Negative Consequences

* **Bundle Size**: Additional JavaScript bundle size compared to simpler storage solutions
* **Complexity**: More complex than simple key-value storage solutions
* **Browser Compatibility**: Limited by IndexedDB browser support (though widely supported)

### Implementation Notes

**Technical Implementation:**
- Install Dexie: `pnpm add dexie`
- Define database schema with tables and indexes
- Implement repository pattern for data access layer
- Configure database versioning and migration strategies
- Set up reactive queries for real-time UI updates
- Implement data synchronization with server APIs

**Patterns Used:**
- Repository pattern: Abstracted data access layer with consistent interface
- Observer pattern: Reactive updates through Dexie's live queries
- Schema versioning: Database migration support for evolving data structures
- Transaction pattern: Atomic operations for data consistency
- Caching strategy: Intelligent caching with TTL and invalidation policies

**Future Considerations:**
- Implement background sync for offline-to-online data synchronization
- Add data encryption for sensitive information storage
- Evaluate Dexie Cloud for synchronized multi-device storage
- Consider implementing data compression for large datasets
- Plan for data export/import functionality for user data portability

### Compliance

All client-side structured data storage must be implemented using Dexie.js. Simple key-value storage can continue using localStorage, but complex data with querying requirements must use the established Dexie database schema.
